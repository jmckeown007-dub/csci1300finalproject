1st Task: Finding Strand Similarity

Strand Similarity:
Your task is to identify the number of matching nucleotides between these two sequences. (input a number)
[strand 1]
[strand 2]

2nd Task: Strand Similarity with different lengths

Strand Similarity II:
Your task is to identify the position in which these two strands of DNA have the most matching nucleotides.
Input the position on the longer strand that the first nucleotide of the shorter strand would align with.
[long strand]
[short strand]

3rd Task: Mutations (strands can be equal or different lengths)

Mutation Identification:
Your task is to identify the number of substitutions made between these two strands in the position where they are best aligned.
[long strand, if there is one]
[short strand]

4th Task: RNA Synthesis

RNA Synthesis:
Your task is to input the nucleotides that this DNA's corresponding RNA would have.
Input sequence fully capitalized, with no spaces. Replace T nucleotides with U nucleotides to complete transcription.
[strand]
